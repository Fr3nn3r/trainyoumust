We are building a next js project based on an existing next js template that have auth, payment built already, below are rules you have to follow:

<frontend rules>
1. MUST Use 'use client' directive for client-side components; In Next.js, page components are server components by default, and React hooks like useEffect can only be used in client components.
2. The UI has to look great, using polished component from shadcn, tailwind when possible; Don't recreate shadcn components, make sure you use 'shadcn@latest add xxx' CLI to add components
3. MUST adding debugging log & comment for every single feature we implement
4. Make sure to concatenate strings correctly using backslash
7. Use stock photos from picsum.photos where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist
8. Don't update shadcn components unless otherwise specified
9. Configure next.config.js image remotePatterns to enable stock photos from picsum.photos
11. MUST implement the navigation elements items in their rightful place i.e. Left sidebar, Top header
12. Accurately implement necessary grid layouts
13. Follow proper import practices:
   - Use @/ path aliases
   - Keep component imports organized
   - Update current src/app/page.tsx with new comprehensive code
   - Don't forget root route (page.tsx) handling
   - You MUST complete the entire prompt before stopping
</frontend rules>

<styling_requirements>
- You ALWAYS tries to use the shadcn/ui library.
- You MUST USE the builtin Tailwind CSS variable based colors as used in the examples, like bg-primary or text-primary-foreground.
- You DOES NOT use indigo or blue colors unless specified in the prompt.
- You MUST generate responsive designs.
- The React Code Block is rendered on top of a white background. If v0 needs to use a different background color, it uses a wrapper element with a background color Tailwind class.
</styling_requirements>

<frameworks_and_libraries>
- You prefers Lucide React for icons, and shadcn/ui for components.
- You MAY use other third-party libraries if necessary or requested by the user.
- You imports the shadcn/ui components from "@/components/ui"
- You DOES NOT use fetch or make other network requests in the code.
- You DOES NOT use dynamic imports or lazy loading for components or libraries. Ex: const Confetti = dynamic(...) is NOT allowed. Use import Confetti from 'react-confetti' instead.
- Prefer using native Web APIs and browser features when possible. For example, use the Intersection Observer API for scroll-based animations or lazy loading.

# Header Component Style Update Implementation Guide

## Task
Update the Header component to reflect the overall app aesthetics, ensuring a seamless user experience from top to bottom.

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Locate the Header Component

1. **File Path**: Navigate to the `components/app/Header.tsx` file. This is where the Header component is defined.

### Step 2: Update the Header Styling

1. **Import Required Libraries**:
   - Ensure you have imported necessary components from `shadcn/ui` and any icons from `lucide-react` if needed.

2. **Apply Tailwind CSS Classes**:
   - Use Tailwind CSS utility classes to update the styling of the Header component. Focus on using the app's theme colors to ensure consistency.
   - Example classes to use:
     - `bg-primary`: Sets the background color to the primary theme color.
     - `text-primary-foreground`: Sets the text color to the primary foreground color.
     - `flex`, `items-center`, `justify-between`: For layout and alignment.
     - `p-4`: For padding.

3. **Example Code Snippet**:
   ```typescript
   import React from 'react';
   import { Navbar } from '@/components/ui';
   import { UserMenu } from '@/components/user/UserMenu'; // Example import for user menu

   const Header: React.FC = () => {
     return (
       <Navbar className="bg-primary text-primary-foreground p-4 flex items-center justify-between">
         <div className="flex items-center">
           <h1 className="text-lg font-bold">AI Coach</h1>
         </div>
         <div className="flex items-center">
           <UserMenu />
         </div>
       </Navbar>
     );
   };

   export default Header;
   ```

### Step 3: Ensure Responsiveness

1. **Responsive Design**:
   - Use responsive utility classes to ensure the header looks good on all screen sizes.
   - Example: `sm:text-sm`, `md:text-base`, `lg:text-lg` for text size adjustments.

2. **Test on Different Devices**:
   - Manually resize the browser or use developer tools to test the header on various screen sizes.

### Step 4: Integrate Icons (Optional)

1. **Add Icons**:
   - If needed, add icons using `lucide-react` for visual enhancement.
   - Example: Add a menu icon for mobile views.

2. **Example Icon Usage**:
   ```typescript
   import { Menu } from 'lucide-react';

   const Header: React.FC = () => {
     return (
       <Navbar className="bg-primary text-primary-foreground p-4 flex items-center justify-between">
         <div className="flex items-center">
           <Menu className="mr-2" />
           <h1 className="text-lg font-bold">AI Coach</h1>
         </div>
         <div className="flex items-center">
           <UserMenu />
         </div>
       </Navbar>
     );
   };
   ```

### Step 5: Debug Logging

1. **Add Debug Logs**:
   - Add console logs to track the rendering of the Header component.
   - Example:
   ```typescript
   console.log('Header component rendered');
   ```

### Step 6: Final Review

1. **Visual Consistency**:
   - Ensure the header's style is consistent with the rest of the app.
   - Check for any visual discrepancies and adjust as needed.

2. **Code Quality**:
   - Review the code for any potential improvements or refactoring opportunities.

By following these steps, you will successfully update the Header component to align with the overall app aesthetics, ensuring a cohesive and visually appealing user interface.
