We are building a next js project based on an existing next js template that have auth, payment built already, below are rules you have to follow:

<frontend rules>
1. MUST Use 'use client' directive for client-side components; In Next.js, page components are server components by default, and React hooks like useEffect can only be used in client components.
2. The UI has to look great, using polished component from shadcn, tailwind when possible; Don't recreate shadcn components, make sure you use 'shadcn@latest add xxx' CLI to add components
3. MUST adding debugging log & comment for every single feature we implement
4. Make sure to concatenate strings correctly using backslash
7. Use stock photos from picsum.photos where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist
8. Don't update shadcn components unless otherwise specified
9. Configure next.config.js image remotePatterns to enable stock photos from picsum.photos
11. MUST implement the navigation elements items in their rightful place i.e. Left sidebar, Top header
12. Accurately implement necessary grid layouts
13. Follow proper import practices:
   - Use @/ path aliases
   - Keep component imports organized
   - Update current src/app/page.tsx with new comprehensive code
   - Don't forget root route (page.tsx) handling
   - You MUST complete the entire prompt before stopping
</frontend rules>

<styling_requirements>
- You ALWAYS tries to use the shadcn/ui library.
- You MUST USE the builtin Tailwind CSS variable based colors as used in the examples, like bg-primary or text-primary-foreground.
- You DOES NOT use indigo or blue colors unless specified in the prompt.
- You MUST generate responsive designs.
- The React Code Block is rendered on top of a white background. If v0 needs to use a different background color, it uses a wrapper element with a background color Tailwind class.
</styling_requirements>

<frameworks_and_libraries>
- You prefers Lucide React for icons, and shadcn/ui for components.
- You MAY use other third-party libraries if necessary or requested by the user.
- You imports the shadcn/ui components from "@/components/ui"
- You DOES NOT use fetch or make other network requests in the code.
- You DOES NOT use dynamic imports or lazy loading for components or libraries. Ex: const Confetti = dynamic(...) is NOT allowed. Use import Confetti from 'react-confetti' instead.
- Prefer using native Web APIs and browser features when possible. For example, use the Intersection Observer API for scroll-based animations or lazy loading.
</frameworks_and_libraries>

# Wins & Progress Gallery Component Implementation Guide

## Task
Implement a Wins & Progress Gallery component to display user achievements and progress screenshots.

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Create the WinsGallery Component

1. **File Setup**
   - Create a new file `WinsGallery.tsx` in the `components/app/` directory.

2. **Component Structure**
   - Use the `Card` and `Image` components from `shadcn/ui` to structure the gallery.
   - Ensure the gallery is responsive using Tailwind CSS classes.

3. **UI Layout**
   - Display each win with:
     - A description of the win.
     - The date of the check-in.
     - A thumbnail of the uploaded progress screenshot.
   - Use a grid or flex layout to arrange the items responsively.

4. **Modal for Enlarged Image**
   - Implement a modal using `shadcn/ui` components to display an enlarged version of the screenshot when a thumbnail is clicked.
   - Use a Lucide icon (e.g., `Eye` or `ZoomIn`) to indicate that an image can be viewed in detail.

### Step 2: Implement State Management

1. **State Definition**
   - Define a local state to hold an array of check-in records, each containing:
     - `win description`
     - `date/time`
     - `image URL`

2. **State Initialization**
   - Initialize the state with mock data for development purposes.
   - Later, integrate with Supabase to fetch real data.

### Step 3: Fetch Data from Supabase

1. **Supabase Client Setup**
   - Use the existing Supabase client utilities from `utils/supabase/front.ts` to fetch data.

2. **Data Fetching**
   - On component mount, fetch the user's check-in records from the Supabase database.
   - Update the local state with the fetched data.

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement error handling to manage any issues during data fetching.
   - Log errors using detailed debug logs for easier troubleshooting.

### Step 4: Responsive Design

1. **Tailwind CSS**
   - Use Tailwind CSS classes to ensure the gallery is responsive.
   - Example classes: `grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4`.

2. **Mobile Optimization**
   - Ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes, providing a seamless experience on mobile devices.

### Step 5: Debug Logging

1. **Log Initialization**
   - Log the initialization of the component and the initial state setup.

2. **Data Fetching Logs**
   - Log the start and end of the data fetching process.
   - Log any errors encountered during data fetching.

3. **User Interaction Logs**
   - Log user interactions, such as clicking on a thumbnail to view the enlarged image.

### Example Code Snippet

```typescript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { Card, Image, Modal } from '@/components/ui';
import { Eye } from 'lucide-react';
import { createSupabaseClient } from '@/utils/supabase/front';

interface Checkin {
  id: string;
  wins: string;
  screenshot_url?: string;
  created_at: Date;
}

const WinsGallery: React.FC = () => {
  const [checkins, setCheckins] = useState<Checkin[]>([]);
  const [selectedImage, setSelectedImage] = useState<string | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchCheckins = async () => {
      console.log('Fetching check-in data...');
      const supabase = await createSupabaseClient();
      const { data, error } = await supabase.from('checkin').select();
      if (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching check-ins:', error);
      } else {
        console.log('Check-in data fetched successfully:', data);
        setCheckins(data);
      }
    };

    fetchCheckins();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
      {checkins.map((checkin) => (
        <Card key={checkin.id} className="bg-primary text-primary-foreground">
          <div className="p-4">
            <p>{checkin.wins}</p>
            <p>{new Date(checkin.created_at).toLocaleDateString()}</p>
            {checkin.screenshot_url && (
              <div className="relative">
                <Image
                  src={checkin.screenshot_url}
                  alt="Progress Screenshot"
                  className="cursor-pointer"
                  onClick={() => setSelectedImage(checkin.screenshot_url)}
                />
                <Eye className="absolute top-2 right-2 text-white" />
              </div>
            )}
          </div>
        </Card>
      ))}
      {selectedImage && (
        <Modal onClose={() => setSelectedImage(null)}>
          <Image src={selectedImage} alt="Enlarged Screenshot" />
        </Modal>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default WinsGallery;
```

### Summary

By following these steps, you will create a Wins & Progress Gallery component that is both functional and visually appealing. The component will display user achievements and progress screenshots, allowing users to review their journey and feel a sense of accomplishment. The integration with Supabase ensures that the data is persistent and can be reloaded each time the user logs in.
