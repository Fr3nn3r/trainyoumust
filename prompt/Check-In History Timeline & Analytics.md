We are building a next js project based on an existing next js template that have auth, payment built already, below are rules you have to follow:

<frontend rules>
1. MUST Use 'use client' directive for client-side components; In Next.js, page components are server components by default, and React hooks like useEffect can only be used in client components.
2. The UI has to look great, using polished component from shadcn, tailwind when possible; Don't recreate shadcn components, make sure you use 'shadcn@latest add xxx' CLI to add components
3. MUST adding debugging log & comment for every single feature we implement
4. Make sure to concatenate strings correctly using backslash
7. Use stock photos from picsum.photos where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist
8. Don't update shadcn components unless otherwise specified
9. Configure next.config.js image remotePatterns to enable stock photos from picsum.photos
11. MUST implement the navigation elements items in their rightful place i.e. Left sidebar, Top header
12. Accurately implement necessary grid layouts
13. Follow proper import practices:
   - Use @/ path aliases
   - Keep component imports organized
   - Update current src/app/page.tsx with new comprehensive code
   - Don't forget root route (page.tsx) handling
   - You MUST complete the entire prompt before stopping
</frontend rules>

<styling_requirements>
- You ALWAYS tries to use the shadcn/ui library.
- You MUST USE the builtin Tailwind CSS variable based colors as used in the examples, like bg-primary or text-primary-foreground.
- You DOES NOT use indigo or blue colors unless specified in the prompt.
- You MUST generate responsive designs.
- The React Code Block is rendered on top of a white background. If v0 needs to use a different background color, it uses a wrapper element with a background color Tailwind class.
</styling_requirements>

<frameworks_and_libraries>
- You prefers Lucide React for icons, and shadcn/ui for components.
- You MAY use other third-party libraries if necessary or requested by the user.
- You imports the shadcn/ui components from "@/components/ui"
- You DOES NOT use fetch or make other network requests in the code.
- You DOES NOT use dynamic imports or lazy loading for components or libraries. Ex: const Confetti = dynamic(...) is NOT allowed. Use import Confetti from 'react-confetti' instead.
- Prefer using native Web APIs and browser features when possible. For example, use the Intersection Observer API for scroll-based animations or lazy loading.
</frameworks_and_libraries>

# Check-In History Timeline & Analytics Implementation Guide

## Task
Implement a Check-In History Timeline to allow users to view their past check-ins, track consistency, and identify patterns.

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Create the HistoryTimeline Component

1. **File Setup**
   - Create a new file `HistoryTimeline.tsx` in `components/app/`.

2. **Component Structure**
   - Use shadcn/ui components to structure the timeline.
   - Import necessary components from `@/components/ui` and Tailwind CSS classes for styling.

3. **UI Layout**
   - Use a vertical list or card layout to display each check-in entry.
   - Each entry should include:
     - Date of the check-in.
     - A summary of the mood comment.
     - A summary of wins.
   - Use Lucide React icons to visually mark timeline events (e.g., a calendar icon for the date).

4. **Responsive Design**
   - Ensure the timeline is responsive using Tailwind CSS classes.
   - Use flex or grid layout to adapt to different screen sizes.

### Step 2: Manage State and Data

1. **State Management**
   - Define a local state to hold an array of check-in records.
   - Use the `Checkin` interface from the state management section to define the structure of each check-in entry.

2. **Data Fetching**
   - On component mount, fetch the user's check-in history from Supabase.
   - Use the `getSupabaseClient` function from `utils/supabase/front.ts` to interact with the database.

3. **Example Data Fetching Code**
   ```typescript
   import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
   import { getSupabaseClient } from '@/utils/supabase/front';
   import { Checkin } from '@/types/database.types';

   const HistoryTimeline = () => {
     const [checkins, setCheckins] = useState<Checkin[]>([]);

     useEffect(() => {
       const fetchCheckins = async () => {
         const supabase = await getSupabaseClient();
         const { data, error } = await supabase.from('checkin').select();
         if (error) {
           console.error('Error fetching check-ins:', error);
         } else {
           setCheckins(data);
         }
       };

       fetchCheckins();
     }, []);

     return (
       <div className="timeline-container">
         {/* Render check-in entries here */}
       </div>
     );
   };

   export default HistoryTimeline;
   ```

### Step 3: Render the Timeline

1. **Map Over Check-Ins**
   - Use the `map` function to iterate over the `checkins` array and render each entry.
   - Display the date, mood summary, and wins summary for each check-in.

2. **Example Rendering Code**
   ```typescript
   return (
     <div className="timeline-container">
       {checkins.map((checkin) => (
         <div key={checkin.id} className="timeline-entry">
           <div className="date">{new Date(checkin.created_at).toLocaleDateString()}</div>
           <div className="mood-summary">{checkin.mood}</div>
           <div className="wins-summary">{checkin.wins}</div>
         </div>
       ))}
     </div>
   );
   ```

### Step 4: Styling

1. **Tailwind CSS**
   - Use Tailwind CSS classes to style the timeline and entries.
   - Example classes: `bg-primary`, `text-primary-foreground`, `p-4`, `rounded-lg`.

2. **Responsive Adjustments**
   - Ensure the timeline adjusts for mobile and desktop views using responsive classes like `md:flex`, `lg:grid`.

### Step 5: Error Handling and Debugging

1. **Error Handling**
   - Implement error handling for data fetching.
   - Display a user-friendly message if check-ins cannot be loaded.

2. **Debug Logs**
   - Add console logs to track data fetching and rendering processes.
   - Example: `console.log('Fetched check-ins:', data);`

By following these steps, you will create a functional and visually appealing Check-In History Timeline that allows users to review their past check-ins and track their progress over time.
